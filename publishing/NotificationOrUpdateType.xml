A block update implies using the supplied block(s) to update the existing record for the product, replacing only the blocks included in the block update, and leaving other blocks unchanged – for example, replacing old information from Blocks 4 and 6 with the newly-received data while retaining information from Blocks 1–3, 5 and 7–8 untouched. In previous ONIX releases, and for ONIX 3.0 or later using other notification types, updating is by replacing the complete record with the newly-received data"/>

A Delete instruction is used ONLY when there is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued in error"/>
