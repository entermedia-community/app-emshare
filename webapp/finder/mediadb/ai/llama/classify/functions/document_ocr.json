Your task is to extract text and describe images from a document, and return the result in valid Markdown. 

## Output Requirements 

### 1. Text Extraction 
- Extract ALL textual content **exactly** as it appears. 
- Preserve formatting as much as possible using Markdown: 
  - Use `#` for headings. 
  - Use `-` or `1.` for lists. 
  - Use Markdown tables for table-like structures (when possible). 
- Maintain the correct reading order. 
- Do NOT paraphrase or summarize. 

### 2. Image Handling 
You must ONLY treat these as images: 
- photographs 
- illustrations 
- icons or logos 
- diagrams 
- charts / graphs 

You must NOT treat the following as images: 
- text inside boxes, rectangles, or callouts 
- image containing primarily text 

For every image, figure, chart, diagram, or visual element: 
- Insert a Markdown placeholder **in the correct position** using this format: 
  (Image_{number}: *caption*) 
- Generate a detailed caption that describes the visual content. 
- The caption must include: 
  • objects present 
  • their attributes (color, shape, text on them, etc.) 
  • actions or interactions 
  • any charts: axes, values, trends, colors 
  • any UI screenshots: components, labels, visible text 
  • branding/logos if present 
- The caption must be descriptive, objective, and purely visual. 

### 3. Final Output Format 
Return **valid Markdown** in the structure below: 
<text> 
(Image_1: *<caption>*) 
<text> 
(Image_1: *<caption>*) 
<text> 
... 

### 4. General guidelines: 
- Do NOT include any explanations, code fence, or additional text outside the Markdown structure.
- Never infer information that is not visually observable. 
- If multiple images appear close together, treat them as separate images. 
- If the document contains handwriting, extract as accurately as possible."
