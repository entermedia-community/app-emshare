	<property id="01" note="The full text of the distinctive title of the item, without abbreviation or abridgement. For books, generally taken from the title page (see codes 11–15 where an alternative title is provided on cover or spine). Where the item is an omnibus edition containing two or more works by the same author, and there is no separate combined title, a distinctive title may be constructed (by the sender) by concatenating the individual titles, with suitable punctuation, as in ‘Pride and prejudice / Sense and sensibility / Northanger Abbey’. Where the title alone is not distinctive, recipients may add elements taken from a collection title and part number etc to create a distinctive title – but these elements should be provided separately by the sender"/>
