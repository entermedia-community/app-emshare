Latitude and Longitude for each point are space-separated, and multiple points are comma-separated. (Note these coordinates use decimal parts of a degree, not minutes and seconds.) ONE point defines the centre of a 4 hectare plot (200m × 200m). TWO points define a line joining opposite corners of a ‘square’ plot bounded by two lines of latitude and two of longitude. THREE or more points define a simple polygon outlining the plot. Lines and polygon edges may not cross a national boundary or the 180° line of longitude. Polygon edges may not intersect. It is good practice to ensure the polygon is drawn clockwise and is ‘closed’ (that is, that the first and last points are identical, so that for example four points define a triangle). If not closed, the closing polygon edge is implied, and to avoid ambiguity, trailing zeros in the latitude and longitude should be explicit. Only for use in ONIX 3.0 or later"/>
