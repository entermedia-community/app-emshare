    The DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) format is an XML-based standard used for structuring, authoring, and publishing technical content. Although primarily designed for technical documentation, DITA can be adapted for use in book publishing. It enables the modular creation of content, allowing authors to reuse information across multiple publications and formats. DITA's metadata capabilities help manage content at a granular level, supporting efficient organization, retrieval, and publication in various output formats, including print, web, and digital books.
