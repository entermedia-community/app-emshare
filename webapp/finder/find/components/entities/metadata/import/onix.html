    ONIX (Online Information Exchange) is an XML-based metadata format widely used in the publishing industry for describing books and other publications. It provides a standardized way for publishers, booksellers, libraries, and others in the book supply chain to share rich and detailed information about titles, including aspects like author details, book format, pricing, and availability. ONIX facilitates accurate and consistent communication of product data, which is crucial for effective book discovery, sales, and distribution across various platforms.
