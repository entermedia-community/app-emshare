    SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) is a set of technical standards for e-learning software products. It enables the creation of reusable, interoperable, and easily accessible learning content. SCORM ensures that content developed by different authors can be used across various learning management systems (LMS) without compatibility issues. It defines how content is packaged, delivered, and tracked, allowing educators and trainers to monitor learner progress, performance, and completion rates effectively. SCORM has been widely adopted in the e-learning industry, making it a key standard for online education and training programs.
